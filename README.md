# Projects based on reinforcement learning algorithms

This repository contains implementation of algorithms of field of study of Reinforcement Learning:

1. Markov Decision Processes (MDPs)
2. Dynamic Programming
3. Monte Carlo
4. Temporal Difference (TD) Learning (Q-Learning and SARSA)
5. Approximation Methods (How to plug in a deep neural network or other differentiable model into RL algorithm)

Example of implementation of Markov Decision Processess for Temporal Difference Learning Q Learning in Grid World
