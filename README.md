# Projects based on reinforcement learning algorithms

This repository contains implementation of algorithms of field of study of Reinforcement Learning:

1. Markov Decision Processes (MDPs)
2. Dynamic Programming
3. Monte Carlo
4. Temporal Difference (TD) Learning (Q-Learning and SARSA)
5. Approximation Methods (How to plug in a deep neural network or other differentiable model into RL algorithm)

Example of implementation of Markov Decision Processes for Temporal Difference Learning Q Learning in Grid World with consecutive construction of the grid with its representation of the best moves from every square. Square marked with T – terminal state, L –  loose state. In image a best action q*(s, a) represents with arrow of every state of grid world.
